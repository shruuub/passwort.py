# passwort.py
a super easy Password-generator made with python.

- The passworts are between 8 and 16 characters.
- The passwort should be directly printed and should also be printed to a file called output.txt
- you need python (IDE) installed for this to work.



Note: This is not my own creation. I just yoinked the Code and posted it on Github.
